# Partition-Based-Clustering-Algorithms

In this project I wrote my own codes for K Means, K Medians, K Modes, K Medoids and K Means++ clustering algorithms in python using numpy, pandas, etc.
The performances of my algorithms and built in algorithms in sklearn are compared by using them on various datasets (like Iris, Glass, etc.).
The clusters formed were evaluated using internal (Calinski Harabasz Index, Davies Bouldin Index, Silhouette Coefficient) and external (Rand Score, Jaccard Score, Fowlkes Mallows Score) clustering metrics in sklearn.metrics.
